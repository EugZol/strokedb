StrokeDB is a distributed document-oriented database engine. 
Main features are complete decentralization, JSON object format, 
metadocuments, integration with runtime (it is just a ruby library). 

= Installing StrokeDB

== Requirements

You need to install few gems in order to run StrokeDB:

	$ sudo gem install diff-lcs activesupport uuidtools

*Note*: There is no need in <tt>uuidtools</tt> if you use JRuby

== Getting source code

	$ git clone git://gitorious.org/strokedb/mainline.git strokedb
or
	$ git clone http://git.gitorious.org/strokedb/mainline.git strokedb

== Installing rubygem

There is no gem for StrokeDB (yet). As soon as we'll release 0.1, it will become available this way, too.
	
== (__Optional__) Running test suite

		$ cd strokedb/strokedb-ruby
		$ rake ci
		$ rake jci # for jruby, jruby should be in PATH
	

= Starting points

One of the most important concepts of StrokeDB is a StrokeDB::Document.


= Running benchmarks

	$ rake bench
