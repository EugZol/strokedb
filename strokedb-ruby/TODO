[x] Skiplist chunking of objects
[ ] JSON library dependency: wrong sha256 version when libs changes behavior (draft own ActiveSupport-compatible JSON implementation?)
[x] MASTER chunk for chunked skiplists (for faster access)
[X] Fix bad UUID implementation in pure ruby version
[ ] Read/Write benchmarks showing dependency of data size
[-] K-d skiplist & specs
[x] Add slot value diffing
[x] Add document patching
[x] Add slot value patching
[ ] Get diff strategy from either 'to' or 'from' (as per discussion with oleganza)
[x] Chained storages
[x] Add reverse chaining for storages
[ ] add created_at/updated_at to Document by default?
[x] Convert Diff to meta
[ ] Pool new UUIDs
[ ] Investigate nested metas issue (View::Cut wasn't possible for some reason)
[ ] Find new versions of earlier documents in View::Cut.emit (check if uuid.version document has previous_version?)

Config:

[x] Allow to chain any number of storages:
	
	config.chain :mem, :memcached, :fs
	config.chain :memcached, :network
	
	These two calls made sequentially should build the following structure:
	
	mem <-> memcached <-> fs
				^
				|
				V
			 network
	
[x] ...and split chaining and authoritative source, they are basically an orthogonal concepts.

	config[:mem].authoritative_source = config[:fs]
	
[ ] Get rid of SkiplistStore.get_new; it doesn't look really nice. May be #initialize should be options-based 
	(and all code needs to be updated), or... don't know, but I really don't like this .get_new [yrashk]

InvertedList index:

[ ] Optimize prefixes
[ ] Serialize & dump
[ ] Range/set query support
[ ] Faster intersection
[ ] Custom boolean operation on results
[ ] Assoc's indexing
[ ] Sub-attributes indexing
