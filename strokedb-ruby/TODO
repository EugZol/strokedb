[ ] It seems that http://gitorious.org/projects/strokedb/repos/mainline/commit/b895a99034f6a1d36d4300f97b705fc4d1df5899 caused a slow down
[ ] New uuid-based versions caused some slow down, too
[ ] add created_at to Document by default? (in addition to lamport ;) (Timestampable meta?)
[ ] Investigate nested metas issue (View::Cut wasn't possible for some reason)
[?] Pool new UUIDs
[ ] Think about non-index named meta lookup
[ ] Get diff strategy from either 'to' or 'from' (as per discussion with oleganza)
[ ] Read/Write benchmarks showing dependency of data size
