[ ] NOT DONE
[?] MAY BE
[.] IN PROGRESS
Completed items are removed.
============================

To be done before 0.1 ("Praha"):

[.] Spec Symbol conversion to String
[ ] Improve PointQuery (I really don't like it)
[ ] Spec SS#autosync
[ ] Spec RemoteStore::DRb
[ ] Refactor Meta#document, fix bugs
[.] Refactor callback stuff in Document
[.] Refactor associations
[ ] Add Document::Versions#first, #head
[.] Add few validations
[ ] Memory-based storage with permanent log?
[?] add sub-finders to associations (like User.messages.find :title => '...')
[?] Add sorting primitives for search functionality
[ ] Document#to_xml can't work with arrays for some reason
[ ] It seems that http://gitorious.org/projects/strokedb/repos/mainline/commit/b895a99034f6a1d36d4300f97b705fc4d1df5899 caused a slow down
[ ] New uuid-based versions caused some slow down, too

To be done later:

[ ] add created_at to Document by default? (in addition to lamport ;) (Timestampable meta?)
[ ] Investigate nested metas issue (View::Cut wasn't possible for some reason)
[?] Pool new UUIDs
[ ] Think about non-index named meta lookup
[ ] Get diff strategy from either 'to' or 'from' (as per discussion with oleganza)
[ ] Read/Write benchmarks showing dependency of data size


UNSORTED
========
InvertedList index:

[ ] Optimize prefixes
[ ] Serialize & dump
[ ] Range/set query support
[ ] Faster intersection
[ ] Custom boolean operation on results
[ ] Assoc's indexing
[ ] Sub-attributes indexing
