[ ] NOT DONE
[?] MAY BE
[.] IN PROGRESS
Completed items are removed.
============================

To be done before 0.1 ("Praha"):

[ ] It seems that http://gitorious.org/projects/strokedb/repos/mainline/commit/b895a99034f6a1d36d4300f97b705fc4d1df5899 caused a slow down
[ ] Spec Symbol conversion to String
[ ] Improve PointQuery (I really don't like it)
[ ] Refactor Meta#document, fix bugs
[.] Refactor callback stuff in Document
[ ] Refactor associations
[ ] Add Document::Versions#first, #head
[ ] Memory-based storage with permanent log?
[?] add sub-finders to associations (like User.messages.find :title => '...')
[?] Add sorting primitives for search functionality

To be done later:

[ ] add created_at to Document by default? (in addition to lamport ;) (Timestampable meta?)
[ ] Investigate nested metas issue (View::Cut wasn't possible for some reason)
[ ] Replace 0000000000000000 with (0){16} in regexps (when http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-2113 will be released)
[?] Pool new UUIDs
[ ] Drop :marshal serialization method or figure out why it is not really working now (run test/playing2.rb with :marshal and see)
[ ] Think about non-index named meta lookup
[ ] Get diff strategy from either 'to' or 'from' (as per discussion with oleganza)
[ ] Read/Write benchmarks showing dependency of data size
