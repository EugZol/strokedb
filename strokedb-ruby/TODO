[ ] NOT DONE
[?] MAY BE
[-] Look into git history, may be you'll find something about it
[.] IN PROGRESS
Completed items are removed.
============================

[ ] Refactor Slot!
[ ] ! Reorganize specs, drop using mockups where it makes little sense
[?] Fix bad UUID implementation in pure ruby version
[ ] Read/Write benchmarks showing dependency of data size
[-] K-d skiplist & specs
[ ] Get diff strategy from either 'to' or 'from' (as per discussion with oleganza)
[ ] add created_at to Document by default? (in addition to lamport ;) (Timestampable meta?)
[?] Pool new UUIDs
[ ] Investigate nested metas issue (View::Cut wasn't possible for some reason)
[ ] Improve tracing references on stack in Document#to_s (I don't like it) 
[ ] Improve PointQuery (I really don't like it)
[-] Finish RangeQuery (we've decided to drop it after ae6371e1f4ffeeb309771b5b6fa1a5233ca4888f)
[ ] Refactor Meta#document, fix bugs
[ ] Think about non-index named meta lookup
[.] Refactor callback stuff in Document â€” call on_initialization only for specified meta (add param to execute_callbacks?)
[ ] "Valid Document's JSON with multiple meta names specified" spec should check callback through message sending, not instance vars
[ ] Drop :marshal serialization method or figure out why it is not really working now (run test/playing2.rb with :marshal and see)
[ ] Add #[index] API to Document::Versions, with negative indexes as well.
[ ] Add Document::Versions#previous, #first, #last, #all, #preceding (all previous)
[ ] Replace 0000000000000000 with (0){16} in regexps (when http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-2113 will be released)

InvertedList index:

[ ] Optimize prefixes
[ ] Serialize & dump
[ ] Range/set query support
[ ] Faster intersection
[ ] Custom boolean operation on results
[ ] Assoc's indexing
[ ] Sub-attributes indexing
