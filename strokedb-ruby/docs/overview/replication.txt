DATA REPLICATION & SYNCHRONIZATION MODEL

The first thing you should carefully understand is that StrokeDB does not
have master-slave replication when one storage is just a copy of another.

Every document may exist in a rather weird tree of revisions, spread across
any number of computers.

Replication model has many common with the Git version control model.
If you are familiar with basics of Git (or Mercurial), it would be easier
to get the idea of StrokeDB replication. Anyway, here some important 
properties of Git:
   
1. Every piece of data is versioned.
2. Document references are versioned.
3. There's no "true central" storage. Synchronization is done by pulling
   changes from one storage to another and 3-way-merging modified documents.

For those, who have read some Git docs, but not getting idea very well,
please read this Linus Torvalds' explanation carefully: 
http://lwn.net/Articles/246381/
    
But there is crucial difference between Git and StrokeDB:
there isn't "all or nothing" approach. Every document is tracked 
individually on a low level. You may pull updates of a single document
without any knowledge of other data. However, in practice you may construct
any version control protocol on top of it (or pick a predefined one) for some
subset of your documents.

Remember: documents may be replicated inside a single storage as well as
across all the computers on the Earth. It is up to application to maintain 
consistency of the data.


GIT MODEL

In instance, you may implement a Git version control model right in the terms 
of StrokeDB. All you have to do is to define 4 kinds of documents (metas):

 * "Blob" is used to store a file data. 
 * "Tree" is document that ties one or more Blobs into a directory structure. 
   In addition, a tree object can refer to other tree objects, thus creating 
   a directory hierarchy. 
 * "Commit" ("Repository") document. For entire repository there is a single Commit
   document with a multiple versions (representing actual commits). 
   Commit ties such directory hierarchies together into a directed acyclic 
   graph of revisions â€” each commit contains the object name of exactly 
   one Tree designating the directory hierarchy at the time of the commit. 
   In addition, a commit refers to "parent" commit objects that describe the 
   history of how we arrived at that directory hierarchy.
 * "Tag" symbolically identifies and can be used to sign other documents.
   It contains the object name and type of another object, 
   a symbolic name (of course!) and, optionally, a signature.

How's this done in StrokeDB? Exactly the way, Git does. Imagine, you have a 
root directory containing files A and B. Initially, there are four documents:
1) First version of a Blob document containing A (say, A.1).
2) First version of a Blob document containing B (say, B.1).
3) First version of a Tree document with references @#A.1 and @#B.1.
   Let's call Tree reference name @#T.1
4) First version of a Repository document with a name of creator,
   and a reference to first root Tree document.
   Reference to a Repository document version would look like @#R.1
   
If you modify an A document, version A.2 is created. To keep repository in
a consistent state, you change reference to A in the upper level Tree object,
thus changing T.1 to T.2. If this is a root tree, you go to a corresponding 
Repository document, update reference to T, thus creating a new version R.2.

Now you have two consistent repository revisions referenced by the versions 
of the Repository document (where commit metadata is stored).

Since, Git model is very useful for various kinds of applications, 
it ships with StrokeDB as a configurable plugin.

Remember, that you may have any number of such repositories in a database
and even overlap them!


SYNCHRONIZATION BASICS

Syncronization starts from the point where you have different document versions
and you wish to "sync" them.

The first important thing is that sync is implemented as a "pull" operation.
You always locate an interesting document and say: i'd like to pull updates 
from the common merge version up to the specified version.
"Remote" document stays untouched. If you wish to implement double-sided sync
you have to pull from A to B and then from B to A.

Kinds of syncs:

  1) Continuous updates:
  
  ---A---B---C---...
      \       \       
       D---E---F---... (F is a merge of E and C)

  2) Fork & merge
  
  ---A---B---C---F---...
      \         /     
       D-------E---... (F is a merge of C and E)

Let's examine pull algorithm with example #1.
Sync start with storages S1 and S2, where versions C and E
are located. You want to pull all updates up to C to S2 storage.

Pull is done in the following steps:

  1) Determine a common version (a "base"). In out case, it is "A".
  2) If S1 and S2 are different and there aren't some intermediate revisions,
     fetch them from S1 to S2 ("B" and "C" namely). 
  3) Do a three-way merge of "E" and "C" with a base "A".
     Conflicts resolution and specific documents merge may be done
     by application (described in metas).
  4) Create a new document version(s) for a merged result.

There is a stroke_diff library in the core of StrokeDB providing 
low-level routines for diffing/patching/merging json data (think of it as a 
true XML diff/merge tool).
It is fully customizable to let you describe specific merge strategies
for you documents.
