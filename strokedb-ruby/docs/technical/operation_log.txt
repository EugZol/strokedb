OPERATION LOG FILE (not finished)

We have 4 major mutation types:
1) Creation
2) Deletion
3) Update (dumb overwrite)
4) Custom

Example:

[ lamport_timestamp, "create", uuid, raw_doc ]  # [10, "create", "12345678...", {'__meta__'=> ...}]
[ lamport_timestamp, "delete", uuid ]
[ lamport_timestamp, "update", uuid, raw_doc ]
(or [ lamport_timestamp, "update", uuid, version_from, raw_diff ]) # TODO: find out what's easier
[ lamport_timestamp, "custom", raw_mutation_doc]

Mutation doc is a doc specifing a transactional mutation. 
E.g. "debit 1% to an account". Operation +1% could be implemented as 
an overwriting update (i.e. "take value", "increment value", 
"store new value"), but it is not merged well in case of concurrent
operations on the same data in a separate storage. To fix this, we 
implement Mutation Docs. 
Meta of the doc specifies type of mutation and its algorithms. 
Doc's slots specify parameters of the mutation.

TODO: specify log merging and replaying.
